## 📌 Overview

**Smart Proctor** is an advanced AI-powered proctoring system designed to enhance the **security, fairness, and credibility** of online examinations. It addresses the challenges of remote assessments by providing a real-time, comprehensive solution for detecting a wide range of suspicious behaviors.

The system integrates modern image processing and deep learning technologies into a modular microservices architecture. It supports features like:

- Facial recognition
- Eye gaze and blinking detection
- Multiple face detection
- Lip movement analysis
- Head pose estimation
- Object and voice activity detection
- AI-generated text detection
- Fullscreen and tab-switching monitoring

## ✨ Features

### 🔍 Detection Modules

- **Face Detection and Recognition**  
  Uses MediaPipe, Haar Cascades, and Dlib to verify student identity in real-time.

- **Eye Gaze & Blinking Detection**  
  Tracks eye movement and blinks using Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) and iris position.

- **Head Pose Estimation**  
  Detects head direction to infer attention and focus.

- **Lip Movement Detection**  
  SVM classifier based on MediaPipe Face Mesh features detects possible whispering.

- **Voice Activity Detection**  
  Employs the YAMNet model to identify speaking during exams.

- **Object Detection**  
  YOLOv8 detects forbidden items (phones, earphones, books, sunglasses, etc.) using a dataset of 17,501 images.

- **AI-Generated Text Detection**  
  Fine-tuned DistilBERT model flags text generated by AI tools to reduce plagiarism.

- **Tab & Fullscreen Monitoring**  
  Detects tab switching and enforces fullscreen mode with real-time alerts.

- **Cheating Report Generation**  
  Structured JSON-based reports with violation types, timestamps, frequency, and sample media.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

Smart Proctor is built with a **microservices architecture**, enabling scalable, modular, and real-time processing. It consists of three main layers:

### 📘 Presentation Layer
Student and admin interfaces built with HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.

### 🧠 Logic Layer
Detection modules process video/audio inputs and feed results to the cheating report generator.

### 💾 Data Layer
Stores student profiles, detection models, logs, and datasets.

Each module runs independently and communicates via **RESTful APIs** or message queues. A coordinator and API Gateway route data efficiently.
